    "optifine": """# When you ask for help, we automatically assume that you don't have OptiFine installed.
## Why?

Well, for starters, **OptiFine breaks a lot of mods**. It was designed for vanilla, and you would know that if you ever had to download a compatability mod between forge/fabric and OF.
Second, **OptiFine is closed source**, which isn't bad by itself, a lot of your favorite mods (for example, thaumcraft) are closed source as well. But since OF is a performance mod, it heavily relies on compatability, and if the mod is closed-source only the creator of said mod can implement that compatability, which means it will probably be very long before all of your mods are supported.
And finally, even with all of these factors OptiFine would've still been usable, **but it is developed by only one person**. And if it couldn't get worse, that person **has said multiple times that they do not consider compatability the first priority**.

OptiFine is "fine" (pun not intended) when used with older versions, because the older versions themselves had less content and thus are better optimized ||(and you don't really have any good alternatives for 1.12/1.7)||. But from 1.16 onwards, OF isn't something you should use.
Instead, check out these **open-source** alternatives: <https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods>! The main ones we recommend are: Rubidium for optimization (https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rubidium) and Oculus for shaders (https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oculus).
