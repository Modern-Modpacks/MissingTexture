ALL BRAINLESS MONKEYS, WHO CAN'T EVEN READ TWO LINES OF TEXT OR CHECK THE FUCKING JEI, ASKING THEIR STUPID, 5-SECOND WORTH OF RESEARCH, QUESTIONS IN CHAT. AND ALL THE OTHER DEGENERATES, WHO CAME TO THIS CHAT JUST TO LOWER THE AVERAGE IQ OF ALREADY SUFFERING IN THAT REGARD CHAT. With this message I adress my hatred for you. You are the species of the very bottom of the GT community... Well fuck, not even GT community, even representatives of RLCraft, SevTech, SF4 and other garbage, don't have such a low IQ. And this isn't even my elitism, which I have to account for, every time I irresistibly want to make a hole in a wall using someone's head. Every single word in this message was thought out magnitudes better than your average thinking process while shitposting in this chat. You are mental impotents. You are incapable of a mere reading of the information that was thought out FOR and INSTEAD OF YOU. Not to mention tasks that really require planning (base design, math). You are braindeads, who are stuck in state of stagnation. I won't dare to judge anyone for not knowing something, but unwillingness to learn yourself and urge to ask every 2 minutes disgusts me, especially considering all the convinces nomi provides, including NEI or manual, which may not explain EVERYTHING but it explains exactly enough to figure out the rest yourself easily. At the times of my \"first modpack\" there was nothing besides atrocious wikis and English forums, for which I didn't have an access at least because I didn't know English. You don't respect the work of devs. Who the fuck did they do all the hard work for? I get it that the main point of the pack is to make GT more accessible and be a great \"first\" modpack from this category - the way the quest book is written proves that. It tells you a lot of basic concepts, from which you can deduce more complex things, and these complex things even explained on the server already through the %t commands. Your ignorance for all of that makes me feel nothing but pure Spanish shame for devs. Nomifactory didn't deserve this kind of community sharing one braincell between everyone. Maybe it was a mistake making a GT modpack for beginners, knowing the modded Minecraft community and knowing what kind of idiots it has. No negative towards devs or chat members who know how to gameign. Answers to incoming questions: Yes, I'm an elitist, seasoned one even, but i'm accounting for that and i'm going easy on you all. My elitism takes only a small role in what i find disgusting about you all, because you need to NEVER open the modpack and don't even know about it to fuck up as much as y'all do. Yes, I'm rather toxic, because how wouldn't you be toxic to people who'll never understand any other language? I would've NEVER been toxic if I saw at least SOME progress, and not the same thing repeated every minute. Yes, I'm a bit biased towards the nomi playerbase, but there wouldn't be any bias if the average IQ at least on the official server would've been at least a few points higher. No, I don't feel any shame or remorse for my words. There shouldn't be any remorse for someone who talks to you in a straight forward way and who's honest to everyone, including themselves. Thanks for everyone's attention, especially people who got affected by this message. Fuck you.",
        "^gregtech": "My father is a gregtech fanatic. Half of our apartment is covered in multiblock machines the worst. On average once am onth someoen steps into a low voltage conduit or a cogwheel and they have to go to the hospital because they got either electrocuted or maimed. In my 22 years of live I underwent 10 such procedures. A week ago when I went there for some random checks the reception girl told me to take off my shoe xD because she thought that it's a cogwheel in my foot again. The second half of our apartment is filled to the brim with printed JEI recipes, forge crash logs, large bronze boilers xD etc. Every week my dad takes a look at all the curseforge pages to gather all the new tech mods. I was foolish enough to teach him into discord because I thought we will save some bandwidth but now he not only downloads the mods but also rots on some obscure discord channels and subreddits for modded mc players and participates in shitstorms about the best ore doublind automations etc. He can scream at the monitor or throw a keyboard out of the window. Once upon a time when he tilted me I made an account there and trolled him by typing some random shit in his threads like botania is a tech mod. My mother couldn't keep up with cooking bigos for him to calm down. Ah, by now on one of the servers he has a \"HIGH VOLTAGE\" rank for racking up 10k posts. When GTNH updates he plays it every day. For like 5 years now I've been making autocrafting contraptions on his server every sunday while he rambles about the supremacy of this overcomplicated shit. When I managet to get into uni he said it's thanks to that because there's a lot of phosphor in the recipes and it makes my brain work better. Every staurday him and his friend Nrmot wake up the entire family with the sound of their quarry running, ore processing etc. Every time we eat together he starts ranting about tech mods and each time the topic gets derailed into mumbling about r/feedthebeast, he gets hyper and gets butthurt durr not enough tech mods threads only adventure hurr, his face gets red every tiem and he walks off the table while cussing and proceeds to read google spreadsheets about the most efficient ways to complete GTNH under 20000 hours to calm down. This year he set up his own server for christmas. Of course he didn't last till the christmas eve and turned it on in our living room. He put on his anti electrocution wristband and spent the entire day tinkering with the server in the middle of the room. The dinner (on a cogwheel-shaped plate) was also eaten there. \[cool\]\[hello\] If I was let within an arm's length to all the tech pack developers I would take and ingame them Once, when I was still in either elementary or middle school, it was my birthday so my father as a gift let me onto his supersymmetry server as an exception. Nice gift bitch. We had a trip fuckwhere beyond our main base, we walk up to what looked like an AI generated junkyard and my dad's eyes are already glowing and he's licking his lips all turned on. He lays down a shit ton of equipment and we're sitting there staring at a bunch of rusty cogs and fucked up cables. After 5 minutes I got bored so I pull out my discman and he hit me with his hand saying that the machinery can hear my music through my headphones and the sound frequencies make it run worse because there's some immersion sound detector mod installed. When I wanted to scratch my ass he started to \"whisper yell\", so that I'll stop twistign around and stop rustling because the sound activated sensors trip off and fuck up the process. I had to sit there motionless for 6 hours straight and look at crafting processes like in some fucking Guantanamo. My birthday is in November so everythign was white and boring as fuck (he installed serene seasons with windows internal clock integration). At some point he stood up, walked 15 meters from the pc and farted claiming that the greg listens. I mentioned that my father had a friend named Nrmot with whom he plays tech modpacks. Prior to that it was hehe Vazkii who accompanied him on his journeys. A ball-shapes man with a stache wearing a BOMBER vest 365 days per year. Him and my father were almost like brothers, he would come to our house with his wife Jenny for christmas etc. At some point my dad had his name-day and Vazkii visited us for hehe a chalice. They got shitfaced drunk and obviously they talked about greg and assembly lines. I was sitting in my room. At some point they started yelling at each other, whether, in general, mekanism or ProjectE is better. >DON'T FUCK WITH ME VAZKII, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE MULTIBLOCKS MEKANISM HAS? PLACE A FEW AND THE SERVER TPS GOES TO SHIT! THAT'S HOW POWERFUL THEY ARE!!!! &#x200B; >FOR FUCK'S SAKE VASCO EMC VALUES THE TABLE CANS TORE ARE IN THE TRILLIONS, YOUR MULTIBLOCKS CAN SUCK ITS COCK &#x200B; >WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU MENTIONINS THE TABLE IF YOU CAN BARELY CRAFT A BASIC ORE DOUBLER. MEKANISM IS THE KING OF MODS LIKE A LION IS THE KING OF THE JUNGLE. And so they begun to wrestle on the floor and me and my mother had to separate them. After that they stopped talking to each other. Last yer Vazkii's wife called saying that he kicked the bucket and that we're invited to the funeral. It so happened that it was my mom who picked up the phone, she gave her condolences, put down the phone and told my father, and he goes like: >Very fucking good That's how much he hated him for his ProjectE. I also mentioned my dad's archnemesis in the form of r/feedtheebast. It became my father's obsession and when ie. it's mentioned in the TV that there was an earthquake somewhere he mumbles that they should finally say something about thefe fuckers from that subreddit's moderation. He stopped frequenting non-modded mc subreddits and discords because he was upset that they don't discuss tech mods and ftb dramas. The CEO of r/feedthebeast was a guy named Awade. For my father he's the embodiment of all harm tech modpacks were ever met with on the subreddit and my dad was a twar with him for years. Once in the past he attended some moderation meeting where Awade was giving a speech and he came back home in a torn up shirt because they had to make him leave with force, that's the kind of tantrums he threw while in there. After his defeat during the physical encounter with the armed forces of FTB he began his partisan mission on the internet which was comprised of chicanery directed at Awade and r/feedthebeast on various forums and local press. He was throwing random bullshit at him like saying that Awade was an undercover Russian agent or that he saw him on the street scratching someone's car with a nail etc. I didn't teach my dad into TOR so it ended with a police visit for defamation and he had to pay Awade 2000 dollars. When he was paying the house was unlivable for a week, he was cursing at bribed courts, FTB, Awade and the entire world in general. According to his shittalk FTB members were some fucking Masons running the world from the shadows, pulling the strings and having their people everywhere. He was also calculating how long he could keep playing on his server paying for electricity with these 2k dollars and was getting butthurt af that, for example, he could get a shit ton of dis kspace for his world with these 2k (a shitload of terabytes). My dad decided sometime during the last year that he absolutely needs to build a stargate to power his entire machine setup because the current methods are too troublesome and don't produce enough RF. >son a stargate is where it's at, the energy flow in immense! &#x200B; but he could neither afford it at his current worls tage nor had he the space to contain it and since he's not a hehe pussy to pay someone for help he invited some local GTNH players on his server and they'll play for free and be able to use his conduits if they build him a sky platform large enough for it. At first they cooperated pretty well but during one of the weekends my dad got sick and he couldn't go questing with them and he had a huge ass ache over it. Additionally his \"friends\" would call him and brag about how good the RNG is today so my dad was just laying down on the bed red from anger while puffing angrily. The situation was being worsened by the fact that he couldn't blame it on anyone which he usually tends to do. Finally he reached the conclusion that it's unjust that they are advancing without him because they all invested into the world and at night, when these guys stopped playing, darted out of the bed unexpectedly. After an hour he came back and tells me that I have to help him with something on his PC. I accompany him to the room and I see GTNH loaded up with him standing on someone else's section of the base xD I ask what he's doing and he tells me that he's griefing his conveyor belts and robbing him of the items he got during his absence because they fucked him over xD Explaining to him that he has no room in his chest system for that crap was pointless. Fortunately he realized that he has no space for all the belts so he just placed them in the middle of the skybase. Using some chains he attached them to a boiler of some sort and he began logging out of the server but suddenly 2 people join - the other guys who realized that something's wrong xD A hugge shitstorm commenced becauset he ystarted yelling about the items and that my dad has to give them back but he screams that they lied to him and that he contributed a ton to the world but he couldn't progress during the weekend. I tried to calm them down so that he doesn't get embarassed cause it was close. After a few minutes the situation looked as follows: \- my dad standing next to the stargate, saying it's his \-the other guys yelling that he has to give it back \- one of them is on half a heart because he tried to forcefully remove my father \- two iron golems built by that guy approaching my father angrily \- mobs looking at them from every direction \- my mother crying and beggin my father to leave it alone and trying to somehow make the golems stop \- me sadfrog.psd At last, the golems pulled my father away from the stargate. I have the other guys the ftb chunks password so that they could get their belts back while they throw some cables at my father as \"payment\" and saying he can't use the stargate anymore and that he better pray they never meet on a public server. My mom managed to convince the gilems not to finish my father off. The guy who was at half a heart decided he will just eat some steak and heal it back up so no point making a fuss about it, he just doesn't want to see my father ever again. My dad still makes shitstorms with them on modded subreddits because there's a sticky thread about them warning people about him. I was observing that hread and I noticed my father failing at trolling it with alts. >Cristopher2348 > >Amount of posts: 1 > >This thread was made by retards! I've known the user anons\_father for a long time and he's a very good man and a great modded player! They want to defame him because they're jealous of his contraptions! Later he also used these trollaccounts to stalk his former stargate colleagues. Whenever one of them made a thread my dad was getting the fuck in there and ie. typed that his machines suck and it's evident he can't automate for shit xD Using these same trollaccounts he would participate in his own threads and when he for example posted a photo of his new autocraft assembly he'd comment >Yeeeeeeeah congrats! Instantly evident that you're a veteran! and then he'd giggle and tell me and my mom to see how they praise him on the sub.",

Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.",

        "optifine": """# When you ask for help, we automatically assume that you don't have OptiFine installed.
## Why?

Well, for starters, **OptiFine breaks a lot of mods**. It was designed for vanilla, and you would know that if you ever had to download a compatability mod between forge/fabric and OF.
Second, **OptiFine is closed source**, which isn't bad by itself, a lot of your favorite mods (for example, thaumcraft) are closed source as well. But since OF is a performance mod, it heavily relies on compatability, and if the mod is closed-source only the creator of said mod can implement that compatability, which means it will probably be very long before all of your mods are supported.
And finally, even with all of these factors OptiFine would've still been usable, **but it is developed by only one person**. And if it couldn't get worse, that person **has said multiple times that they do not consider compatability the first priority**.

OptiFine is "fine" (pun not intended) when used with older versions, because the older versions themselves had less content and thus are better optimized ||(and you don't really have any good alternatives for 1.12/1.7)||. But from 1.16 onwards, OF isn't something you should use.
[Instead, check out these **open-source** alternatives](<https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods>)!
