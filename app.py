ALL BRAINLESS MONKEYS, WHO CAN'T EVEN READ TWO LINES OF TEXT OR CHECK THE FUCKING JEI, ASKING THEIR STUPID, 5-SECOND WORTH OF RESEARCH, QUESTIONS IN CHAT. AND ALL THE OTHER DEGENERATES, WHO CAME TO THIS CHAT JUST TO LOWER THE AVERAGE IQ OF ALREADY SUFFERING IN THAT REGARD CHAT. With this message I adress my hatred for you. You are the species of the very bottom of the GT community... Well fuck, not even GT community, even representatives of RLCraft, SevTech, SF4 and other garbage, don't have such a low IQ. And this isn't even my elitism, which I have to account for, every time I irresistibly want to make a hole in a wall using someone's head. Every single word in this message was thought out magnitudes better than your average thinking process while shitposting in this chat. You are mental impotents. You are incapable of a mere reading of the information that was thought out FOR and INSTEAD OF YOU. Not to mention tasks that really require planning (base design, math). You are braindeads, who are stuck in state of stagnation. I won't dare to judge anyone for not knowing something, but unwillingness to learn yourself and urge to ask every 2 minutes disgusts me, especially considering all the convinces nomi provides, including NEI or manual, which may not explain EVERYTHING but it explains exactly enough to figure out the rest yourself easily. At the times of my \"first modpack\" there was nothing besides atrocious wikis and English forums, for which I didn't have an access at least because I didn't know English. You don't respect the work of devs. Who the fuck did they do all the hard work for? I get it that the main point of the pack is to make GT more accessible and be a great \"first\" modpack from this category - the way the quest book is written proves that. It tells you a lot of basic concepts, from which you can deduce more complex things, and these complex things even explained on the server already through the %t commands. Your ignorance for all of that makes me feel nothing but pure Spanish shame for devs. Nomifactory didn't deserve this kind of community sharing one braincell between everyone. Maybe it was a mistake making a GT modpack for beginners, knowing the modded Minecraft community and knowing what kind of idiots it has. No negative towards devs or chat members who know how to gameign. Answers to incoming questions: Yes, I'm an elitist, seasoned one even, but i'm accounting for that and i'm going easy on you all. My elitism takes only a small role in what i find disgusting about you all, because you need to NEVER open the modpack and don't even know about it to fuck up as much as y'all do. Yes, I'm rather toxic, because how wouldn't you be toxic to people who'll never understand any other language? I would've NEVER been toxic if I saw at least SOME progress, and not the same thing repeated every minute. Yes, I'm a bit biased towards the nomi playerbase, but there wouldn't be any bias if the average IQ at least on the official server would've been at least a few points higher. No, I don't feel any shame or remorse for my words. There shouldn't be any remorse for someone who talks to you in a straight forward way and who's honest to everyone, including themselves. Thanks for everyone's attention, especially people who got affected by this message. Fuck you.",

    "optifine": """# When you ask for help, we automatically assume that you don't have OptiFine installed.
## Why?

Well, for starters, **OptiFine breaks a lot of mods**. It was designed for vanilla, and you would know that if you ever had to download a compatability mod between forge/fabric and OF.
Second, **OptiFine is closed source**, which isn't bad by itself, a lot of your favorite mods (for example, thaumcraft) are closed source as well. But since OF is a performance mod, it heavily relies on compatability, and if the mod is closed-source only the creator of said mod can implement that compatability, which means it will probably be very long before all of your mods are supported.
And finally, even with all of these factors OptiFine would've still been usable, **but it is developed by only one person**. And if it couldn't get worse, that person **has said multiple times that they do not consider compatability the first priority**.

OptiFine is "fine" (pun not intended) when used with older versions, because the older versions themselves had less content and thus are better optimized ||(and you don't really have any good alternatives for 1.12/1.7)||. But from 1.16 onwards, OF isn't something you should use.
Instead, check out these **open-source** alternatives: <https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods>! The main ones we recommend are: Rubidium for optimization (https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rubidium) and Oculus for shaders (https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oculus).
